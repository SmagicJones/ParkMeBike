# ParkMeBike

## Whats all this then?

Out somewhere new on the bike and need a snack? Need somewhere decent to park your bike?

The ParkMeBike app uses CycleStreets API to find cycle parking spaces nearby or anywhere you look on the map.

Users can sign up/sign in and then they are redirected to the main page.  Here you can view your location (live tracking), find cycle parking, view a picture of the location of the parking (provided by googleStreets) and also adjust the search radius and number of parking spots with the control panel modal.
